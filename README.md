# DN1010 Orbital Project, Team ID: 6506

## Overview
**Level of achievement**:  
Gemini  

**Project Scope**:  
The production of a game titled CS1010 Coding Adventures which teaches basic programming in a fun manner.

CS1010 Coding Adventures is a 2D, 8-bit style game inspired by old RPGs such as the earlier Pokemon games. The game is designed to teach players basic programming concepts such as conditional statements and loops, implemented in the C programming language. It consists of a 2D map with several locations for players to explore, with each location teaching a specific programming concept. The game has two main types of Non-playable Characters (NPCs), the first type who will share programming knowledge with players and teach them the respective C syntax and another type who tests the player's newfound knowledge by giving them tasks to complete. These tasks are practices which use different methods to get the players to apply programming knowledge, based off methods used in some popular basic programming methodology modules.

## Trying out the game
### Required software
To test out the game, the following software should be installed on the device used:
- Python (ideally v3.10 and above), this can be installed via the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). The documentation for the Windows installer can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#the-full-installer).
- Pygame v2.5.2, this can be installed by running the following command in terminal (after installing Python): `pip install pygame`
- PyTmx, this can be installed with the command: `pip install pytmx`
- Note that the above instructions are for devices running Windows. There are separate installation pages for [Linux](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/) and [MacOS](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/), though it is probably easier to do it via terminal with the pip3 installer.
### Run procedure
Follow these steps to run the application. Steps 2 and 3 are for running through terminal, steps 4 and 5 are for running through Visual Studio Code.
1. Clone this repository into an empty folder on your device with `git clone https://github.com/lwenyi1/DN1010`.
   - Note that this assumes you have Git installed on your device, if not it can be installed from the [Git downloads page](https://git-scm.com/download/win).  
2. Open the project folder using your terminal of choice and enter the game_files folder with `cd game_files`
3. Run the main.py module with `python3 main.py`. This should run the game application in its own window.  
4. Open the game_files folder in VSC using the explorer.
5. Open main.py and run the code from there. This should run the game application in its own window.
